# The Chuck Norrizer

The Chuck Norrizer is a web application that accesses [The Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/api/), an API that has access to over 500 Chucnk Norris jokes, and lets you put your own name in the jokes. It is my first project for my Software Engineering Emersive Course at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/).
